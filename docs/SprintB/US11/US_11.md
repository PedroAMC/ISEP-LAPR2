# US 11 - List Employees

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

*As an administrator, I want to get a list of Employees with a given function/role.*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

> ------------------


**From the customer clarifications:**

> - **Question:**
    > "Regarding US011, is there any requirement or input that the Administrator must insert to get the list of the employees? What are the criteria that those employees need to meet to appear on that list? Does the list of employees have any relevance on the functionality of the application? Should we assume SNSUsers must also appear on that list?"
>- **Answer:**
>  I just answered a question that will clarify your doubts. Moreover, the SNS user is not an Employee.

> - **Question:**
    > "Should we give the user the possibility of listing employees from more than 1 role?"
>- **Answer:**
> The Administrator should select a given role and all employees associated with the selected role should be listed.
> - **Question:**
    > Should the list be sorted in any specific way(for example alphabetical name order) or should we give the option to sort by other characteristics?"
>- **Answer:**
   > For now I just want to get a list of employees without considering the order of presentation.

<br/>

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

*No Acceptance Criteria was specified.*

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- *We can find an dependency with US10 since the employees need to be registered in the system in order to be listed by the Administrator.*

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

> - *Input data:*
    <br/>
    Employee function/role (selected)

> - *Output data:*
    <br/>
    List of employees


### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

![US11-SSD](SSD/US_11_SSD.svg)

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

*To use this function, there needs to be atleast one employee registered in the System.*


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.* 

![US11-MD](DM/US_11_DM.svg)

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*The employees are to be listed in no particular order.* 


## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1: Requests to list employees 		 |	...interacting with the actor? | AdminListEmployeesUi        |Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model. |
| | ... coordinating the US? | ListEmployeeController | Controller. | 
| Step 2: Requests data (employeeRole)	 |	n/a						 |             |                              |
| Step 3: inputs the data	 | ...retrieving employeeList	| ListEmployeeController            | Controller  |
| | ... knowing EmployeeStore? | Company | IE: Company knows the EmployeeStore to which it is delegating some tasks. |
| | ... coordinating the US? | ListEmployeeController | Controller. |
| Step 4: displays employees | ... showing the data? 	| AdminListEmployeesUi  |IE: responsible for user Interaction.|

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Company
* Employee

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
* AdminListEmployeesUi
* ListEmployeeController
* EmployeeMapper
* EmployeeDto
* EmployeeStore

# 4. Tests 


**Test 1:** Check that the filtration of employees by role is done successfully.

	@Test
    public void testGetEmployeeList(){

        ListEmployeeController listEmployeeController = new ListEmployeeController();
        RegisterEmployeeController registerEmployeeController = new RegisterEmployeeController();

        EmployeeDto coordinator = new EmployeeDto("pedro@isep.pt", "Pedro", "COORDINATOR", 911111111, 15555555, "Praceta Isep, n.ยบ45");
        EmployeeDto coordinator2 = new EmployeeDto("antonio@isep.pt", "Antonio", "COORDINATOR", 922222222, 111111111, "Praceta Isep, n.ยบ46");
        EmployeeDto nurse = new EmployeeDto("miguel@isep.pt", "Miguel", "NURSE", 933333333, 22222222, "Praceta Isep, n.ยบ47");

        registerEmployeeController.createEmployee(coordinator);
        registerEmployeeController.registerEmployee();
        registerEmployeeController.createEmployee(coordinator2);
        registerEmployeeController.registerEmployee();
        registerEmployeeController.createEmployee(nurse);
        registerEmployeeController.registerEmployee();

        List<EmployeeDto> expectedList = new ArrayList<EmployeeDto>();
        expectedList.add(coordinator);

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*A new option on the Admin menu ui was added.*

# 7. Observations

*The showcase of available employee roles could have been more dinamic, incase more roles need to be added to the system in the future*
