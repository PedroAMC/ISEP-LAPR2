# US 13 - New vaccine and administration process

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

*As an administrator, I want to specify a new vaccine, and it's administration process.*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

> The vaccine administration process is divised into multiple age groups, with each age group varying on the amount of doses to be administered, the dosage, and the time intervale between each dose.


**From the customer clarifications:**

> - **Question:**
> "As to the interval between doses, what time format are we to use? (e.g. days, weeks, months)"
>- **Answer:**
>  "Number of days."

> - **Question:**
> "We would like to know if when specifying a new Vaccine and its Administration Process, should a list of the existing types of vaccines be displayed in order for him to choose one, or should he just input it?"
>- **Answer:**
> "If the information is available in the system, it is a good practice to present the information to the user and ask the user to select"

> - **Question:**
> "When specifying a Vaccine and its Administration Process, are there any rules for the following attributes? (Name; Id; Brand; Number of doses; Dosage)"
>- **Answer:**
   > "During Sprint B I will not introduce attribute rules/formats other than the ones that I already introduced (in this forum or in the project description). Please study the concepts and define appropriate formats for the attributes."

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

*No Acceptance Criteria was specified.*

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- *We can find a dependency with US12, since a vaccine type must be specified beforehand, for there to be possible to register a specific vaccine for it.*

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

> - *Input data:*
    <br/>
    Vaccine type of the new vaccine<br/>
    Specified vaccine name<br/>
    Age group<br/>
    Total amount of doses to be administered<br/>
    Vaccine dosage<br/>
    Time interval between doses

> - *Output data:*
    <br/>
    List of vaccine types<br/>

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

*To use this function, there needs to be at least one vaccine type registered in the System.*


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.*

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*The vaccine types are to be listed in no particular order.* 


## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |							 |             |                              |

| Step 10  		 |							 |             |                              |  


### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Vaccine
 * Administrator
 * Vaccine Type

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * VaccineUI  
 * VaccineController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![USXXX-SD](USXXX-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*Should the parameters for the new vaccine be stated before or after specifying the vaccine type? </br>
Should we specify the vaccine type and the parameters at the same time?*
