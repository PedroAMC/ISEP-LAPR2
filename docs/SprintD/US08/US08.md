# US 08 - As a nurse I want to record the administration of a vaccine to a SNS user

## 1. Requirements Engineering 

### 1.1 User Storu Description 
*As a nurse I want to record the administration of a vaccine to a SNS user*

### 1.2 Customer Specifications and Clarifications 
**From the specifications document:**
> - A nurse responsible for administering the vaccine will use the application to check the list of SNS users that are present in the vaccination center and call on SNS user to administrate the vaccine. The nurse checks the user info and health conditions in the system and in accordance with the scheduled vaccine type, and the SNS user vaccination history, (s)he gets system instructions regarding the vaccine to be administered (e.g.: vaccine and respective dosage considering the SNS user age group). After giving the vaccine to the user, each nurse registers the event in the system, more precisely, registers the vaccine type (e.g.: Covid-19), vaccine name/brand (e.g.: Astra Zeneca, Moderna, Pfizer), and the lot number used. Afterwards, the nurse sends the user to a recovery room, to stay there for a given recovery period. 

**From the costumer specifications:**
>  - **Question**
     "As we can read in Project Description, the vaccination flow follows these steps: 1. Nurse calls one user that is waiting in the waiting room to be vaccinated; 2. Nurse checks the user's health data as well as which vaccine to administer; 3. Nurse administers the vaccine and registers its information in the system. The doubt is: do you want US08 to cover steps 2 and 3, or just step 3?"
> - **Answer**
    1.The nurse selects a SNS user from a list. 2. Checks user's Name, Age and Adverse Reactions registered in the system. 3. Registers information about the administered vaccine.

<br/>

### 1.3 Acceptance Criteria 
> - *At the end of the recovery period, the user should receive a SMS message informing the SNS user that he can leave the vaccination center.*
> - *The nurse should select a vaccine and the administered dose number.*

### 1.4 Found out Dependencies 
*There are dependencies with US4, because the list of arrivals is necessary. Besides that there are dependencies with US5, for vaccination order purposes.*

### 1.5 Input and Ouput Data
> - *Input data:*
<br/>
    SNS number
<br/>
    Vaccine Type 
<br/>
    Vaccine Brand
<br/>
    Administered dose number

> - *Sent Data:*
<br/>
    SMS message (if authorized)

> - *Output data:*
<br/>
    Message of sucess/failure

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1: requests to register an administration |  ... instantiating a new vaccine administration ?| VaccineAdministrationMapper| Creator Patter: Rule 4 ("B has the data used to initialize A).                              | | ... interacting with the actor ? | VaccineAdministrationUi | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model. |
| | ... coordinating the US? | VaccineAdministrationController | Controller. | 
| Step 2: shows SNS users in the waiting room 	 |	...knowing the users arrived?		|  VaccinationCenter     | IE: stores all the arrivals at a centers                           |
|| ... showing the information? | VaccineAdministrationUi | IE: knows all the users.
|Step 3: request data...| n/a ||||
|Step 4: inputs the data| ... saving the inputted data? | VaccineAdministration|IE: owns its data.|
||... transfer the data typed in the UI to the Domain| VaccineAdministrationDto | DTO: When there is so much data to transfer, it is better to opt by using a DTO in order to reduce coupling between UI and domain.
||... knows VaccineAdministrationStore? | Company | IE: Company knows the VaccineAdministrationStore to which it is delegating some tasks|
| Step 5: Shows the data and asks for confirmation| ... showing the data?| VaccineAdministrationUI| IE: responsible for user Interaction.|
|Step 6: confirms/deny the information|	... validating all data (local validation)?| VaccineAdministration |IE: owns its data.
|| ... validating all data (global validation)?| VaccineAdministrationStore| 	IE: knows all the users.
||... saving the created vaccine administrations?|VaccineAdministrationStore| 	IE: knows all the vaccine vaccine administration.|
|Step 6: informs success/failure| ... informing operation success?|vaccineAdministrationUI | IE: responsible for user Interaction.

### Systematization ###

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 
* Company
* VaccineAdministration
* AdministrationProcess

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
* VaccineAdministrationController
* VaccineAdministrationUi
* VaccineAdministrationStore
* VaccineAdministrationDto
* VaccineAdministrationMapper
* AdministrationProcessStore
* AdministrationProcessDto
* AdministrationProcessStore
* AdverseReactionsStore
* AdverseReactionsDto
* AdverseReactionsMapper

# 4. Tests

**Test 1:**

class VaccineTypeStoreTest {

    @Test
    public void testCreation(){

        VaccineTypeStore store = new VaccineTypeStore();
        VaccineTypeDto dto = new VaccineTypeDto("AF23P","Covid-19 vaccine", 3);
        VaccineTypeDto dto2 = new VaccineTypeDto("AF23P","Covid-19 vaccine", 3);
        VaccineType type = new VaccineType("AF23P","Covid-19 vaccine", 3);
        //Expected list of vaccine types in the current store
        List<VaccineType> expectedList = new ArrayList<>();
        expectedList.add(type);
        //method to add the vaccine type to the store
        store.createVaccineType(dto);

        //Test to see if the actual list is equal to the expected store
        assertEquals(store.getVaccineTypes(),expectedList);

        //test to see if a vaccine type already exists it fails
        assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class,() -> {
            store.createVaccineType(dto2);
        });
    }

**Test 2:** 

class NotificationTest {

    @Test

    public void testNotification(){

        Notification notification = new Notification("diogo@gmail.com","Welcome to the DGS app");

        assertEquals("diogo@gmail.com",notification.getAddress());
        assertEquals("Welcome to the DGS app",notification.getMessage());
    }

}
